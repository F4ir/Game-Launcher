# Game-Launcher
Quicker way to launch your games from 1 script/application.

# How-To
It is really simple. Make a shortcut of the games EXE or copy the existing made shortcut of the game and place it in the folder ```gamefiles```.
If you did it right u can see the game pop up in the Launcher, and you can do it with the rest of your games.
